[Workshop Info by MKC Maribor](https://mkc.si/koledar/2021/4/23/kons-rosi-grillmair-konda-poezija)
A conversation with poets about programming languages as a form of literature. We translate poems into code. We use syntax highlighting for visually interesting code snippets. We write, perform and format code poems. We execute them on each others minds.
